This Python code is designed to analyze and visualize data from multiple text files that presumably contain acceleration data. Here’s a breakdown of what the code does:

Imports necessary libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries - pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib for data visualization.

Reads data from text files: The code reads data from multiple text files into a pandas DataFrame. Each file’s data is stored as a numpy array in a dictionary, with the file’s name as the key.

Calculates cumulative sum: The code calculates the cumulative sum of the data to derive speed and displacement. The speed is calculated by taking the cumulative sum of the acceleration data and multiplying it by 0.005. The displacement is calculated by taking the cumulative sum of the speed data and multiplying it by 0.005.

Creates subplots for each dataset: The code creates three subplots for each dataset - one for acceleration, one for speed, and one for displacement. It plots the respective data on each subplot.

Displays the plots: Finally, the code displays the plots using plt.show().
